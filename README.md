Introduction to NoSQL
NoSQL databases (aka "not only SQL") are non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph. They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.
 
When people use the term “NoSQL database,” they typically use it to refer to any non-relational database. Some say the term “NoSQL” stands for “non-SQL” while others say it stands for “not only SQL.” Either way, most agree that NoSQL databases are databases that store data in a format other than relational tables.
 
NoSQL databases are used in nearly every industry. Use cases range from the highly critical (e.g., storing financial data and healthcare records) to the more fun and frivolous (e.g., storing IoT readings from a smart kitty litter box).
In the following sections, we'll explore when you should choose to use a NoSQL database and common misconceptions about NoSQL databases.
